I was finding the error checking on edge cases and faulty input to be more trouble than it was worth, so I implemented dropdowns to choose the key and chord type.

If this had been an actual app I was working on, I would probably have called for this in the design phase. I would argue with UX that since there are only 12 keys, and a given number of chords that we want to support, that dropdowns would certainly be a more efficient and maintainable solution compared to having users enter the chord names as text.
